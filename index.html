      <p>As a woman in tech and a budding software developer, I bring a fresh perspective and a drive to excel in the dynamic world of technology. My journey into software development began with a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to learning and growth. Despite being a beginner, I embrace challenges with enthusiasm and approach each project with a tenacity to learn and improve.<br>
        <br>Being a woman in a predominantly male-dominated field has its challenges, but I see it as an opportunity to pave the way for diversity and inclusivity in tech. I am determined to break barriers and inspire others by showcasing the value and creativity that women bring to the industry.
        With a foundation in programming languages and a thirst for knowledge, I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals. My journey as a software developer is just beginning, but I am dedicated to honing my skills, expanding my knowledge, and making a meaningful impact in the world of technology.</p>

      <p>Back in my school days, I wasn't exactly acing math tests.
         It just wasn't my forte. But here I am today, a software developer. 
         It's funny how things turn out sometimes, isn't it? Growing up, I was all about gaming. 
         I had a mountain of games on my phone , I think I hit 80 at one point. And those old PlayStations? Yeah, I begged my parents for those too. 
         Despite the doubts and discouragement thrown my way, I stuck to my guns. People kept saying, "You'll never make it, don't even bother.
         " But I didn't listen. And look where I am now , living proof that determination can take you places you never thought possible. 
         So, here's my advice: don't ever listen to anyone who tells you it's not possible. Remember Romans 8:18 "The pain you're feeling now cannot compare to the joy that's coming.
         " Keep pushing forward, and you'll surprise even yourself with what you can achieve.</p>
